## What
  PawDio is a "drum pad" that allows users to play sounds by pressing down on corresponding keys. It was made with a "party" environment in mind, inspiring its colorful and animated features.
  
## Why
  This project was brainstormed to focus heavily on the practice of JavaScript. The goal was not to write the most cleanest/efficient code possible but to just have everything work as planned.
  
## How
  The languages used were *HTML*, *CSS*, and *JavaScript*. The JavaScript brought the drum pad to life by playing/stopping/looping sounds, animating the logo when sounds are played and by changing the atmosphere when "party lights" are applied. The logo used here was made and edited in GIMP and Inkscape. The Sounds were downloaded from https://99sounds.org/drum-samples/. 
  
## Page Description
  At the center of the page, a "drum pad board" holds the "pads"(keys) that play sounds when pushed down. Every time the page is opened and or refreshed, the colors surrounding the keys randomly change. When a key is "pressed", the bordering key color is increased and the font size of the letter is decreased to make it look like it's actually being pressed. When a key is pressed, the logo hanging onto the "board" begins bobbing its head by using JavaScript that is linked to the CSS class lists that change its transform. The head continuously bobs when the "loop sample" is initiated which also loops a sound. "party lights" can also be turned on, changing the background color randomly. Loops can be stopped with a press of a key. Sounds and loops can be played together for your next hit song.
