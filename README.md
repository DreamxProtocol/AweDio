# PawDio
Inspired by my love for music, Sega Sound Team, and Capcom Sound Team. In this project, I wanted to make a "drum pad" that would be capable of making at least one good beat. You can loop audio samples in this project and add a twist to it all by activating the party lights. My cat logo from a previous project makes a guest appearance here.
